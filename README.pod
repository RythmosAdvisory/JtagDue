=head1 JtagDue Project

The main goal of this project is to provide an up-to-date, comfortable bare-metal C++
programming environment for the Arduino Due, with assertions, STL library
and C++ exception support.

A secondary goal is to convert the Arduino Due into an OpenOCD JTAG adapter
by emulating a Bus Pirate from Dangerous Prototypes.
The Arduino Due has a faster USB port and a faster CPU, so it can easily outperform the Bus Pirate.

I made a quick test, and GDB's 'load' command reports a transfer rate of 85 KiB/s with the JtagDue firmware,
compared to 8 KiB/s with the Bus Pirate. Note that I had to manually patch OpenOCD 0.7.0-dev as of May 2013 in order
for setting "buspirate_speed fast" to work, otherwise you have to revert back to "buspirate_speed normal",
and then you get just 1 KiB/s with the Bus Pirate. If you modify OpenOCD to use bigger USB packets,
you can reach 100 KiB/s with the JtagDue.

The JTAG features with the JtagDue firmware on the Arduino Due are severely limited though:

=over

=item * The JTAG interface can only handle 3.3 V signals.

=item * There is no JTAG clock speed setting, just like the current Bus Pirate / OpenOCD combination (as of May 2013).

The JTAG clock always runs at maximum speed, which may be too fast for some devices.
I made some imprecise measurements, and the resulting TCK rate is around 3 MHz.
This means there is no JTAG adaptive clocking support either.

=item * The JTAG signals are driven by software and their timings are not clean.

For example, TCK does not stay 50 % of the time high.
The lowest-level JTAG bit shifting routine should be written in assembly, help in this area would be appreciated.

=item * The Arduino Due pull-ups are too weak to be of any use, see comments about setting 'buspirate_pullup' below.

=head1 Installation instructions

=over

=item 1) Build the toolchain.

Change to the 'Toolchain' subdirectory and type "make help" for more information.

=item 2) Download and unpack the Atmel Software Framework into some directory of your choice.

=item 3) Build the JtagDue firmware for the Arduino Due like most Autotools projects:

=over

=item a) Make sure the new toolchain's 'bin' subdirectory is in the PATH.

=item b) Run autogen.sh in the 'Project' subdirectory.

=item c) It is best to build out of the source tree like this:

  mkdir obj
  cd obj
  ../Project/configure --prefix=/some/bin/directory --with-atmel-software-framework=<directory where the ASF is>
  make  --no-builtin-rules  -j $(( $(getconf _NPROCESSORS_ONLN) + 1 ))
  make install

=back

=item 4) Flash the new firmware.

You will need the Bossac tool in order to download the firmware into the Arduino Due.
The easiest way to get it is probably to install the Arduino software environment.

Alternatively, you could use the Arduino Due's JTAG port to download the firmware with GDB,
but then you need some other JTAG adapter. I have used the Bus Pirate for that purpose.

=item 5) Test whether the new firmware is working properly.

Plug the USB cable into the Arduino Due's "native" USB socket (as opposed to the "programming" socket).

If you are running Windows, you will be prompted the first time to install a driver for the new device,
just point it to the "WindowsDriver" subdirectory. The .INF file in that subdirectory is actually just
a special text file that associates JtagDue's USB IDs to Windows' own USB CDC driver,
so that a standard "COMx" virtual serial port is automatically created upon connection.
Unfortunately, you cannot choose a fixed serial port number (the "x" in the name), so that
it will change from time to time depending on how many virtual serial ports currently exist
on the system.

Linux and Mac OS do no need any drivers. On linux, a new virtual serial port device
is automatically created with a name like "/dev/ttyACM0", just look for the right device name
under the "/dev" directory.

Now you should be able to connect to the virtual serial port with your favorite serial port console emulator.

For example, this Linux client allows you to conveniently quit the client-side terminal emulator
(the local 'socat' command) with Ctrl+C:

  socat READLINE,echo=0 /dev/ttyACM0,b115200,raw,echo=0,crnl

The JtagDue firmware does not implement the usual command-line editing comfort features yet, like
command history and all the standard cursor key movements, but you can use the Readline library
on the client side instead as follows:

  # Without READLINE, but so that Ctrl+C still quits socat:
  socat -,echo=0,icanon=0 /dev/ttyACM0,b115200,raw,echo=0,crnl

Due to a protocol limitation, there is no welcome banner. Press the Enter key at least once
to see the cursor ('>'), or type "help" for a list of available commands.

=item 6) Create a Linux I<< udev >> rule in order to get the same "/dev/jtagdue1" name every time.

When you connect the Arduino Due to your Linux PC, you will get a new virtual serial port like
/dev/ttyACM0 or /dev/ttyACM1, depending on how many serial ports currently exist on the system.
If you wish to write your own scripts to automate JTAG tasks,
it is desirable that the assigned device name is always the same.

The JtagDue firmware uses the standard Arduino Due Vendor ID, but uses a Device ID of 0x1234
(you can change it when configuring the build). It also reports a serial number of "JtagDue1".
In order to get a fixed /dev/jtagdue1 device name,
create a new file called /etc/udev/rules.d/47-JtagDue.rules (as root) with the following content:

  SUBSYSTEM=="tty" ATTRS{idVendor}=="2341" ATTRS{idProduct}=="1234" ATTRS{serial}=="JtagDue1" MODE="0666" SYMLINK+="jtagdue1"

Theoretically, you can add a GROUP="some_group" option in order to restrict access to a particular user group,
but I could not make it work on my system.

The next time you plug the Arduino Due, if it is running the JtagDue firmware, an entry like /dev/ttyACM1
will still be created, but there will also be a /dev/jtagdue1 link pointing to the right one.
Restarting udev with "sudo restart udev" should not be necessary for the new rule file to be taken into account.

=item 7) Connect the JTAG pins to the target device.

You can see the JTAG signal pin numbers on the Arduino Due and their current state (as if they all were inputs)
with command "JtagPins". This is the kind of output generated:

  TDI   (pin 42): high  |  GND2  (pin 43): low
   -    (pin 44):  -    |  nTRST (pin 45): high
  TMS   (pin 46): high  |  nSRST (pin 47): high
  TDO   (pin 48): high  |  VCC   (pin 49): high
  TCK   (pin 50): high  |  GND1  (pin 51): low

This is the same pin layout as the 10-pin Altera USB Blaster connector, with some
Atmel additions from the AVR JTAG header.

With the command above you can also verify that at least the ground signals (GND1 and GND2)
are low and the VCC signal is high after connecting the JTAG cable.

=item 8) Connect to the JtagDue with OpenOCD.

You will need to disconnect the command console beforehand if you have it open.

Configure OpenOCD as if your JTAG adapter were a Bus Pirate, but bear in mind that:

=over

=item * Option 'buspirate_speed' has no effect, the USB transfer speed will always be the maximum available.

=item * Option 'buspirate_vreg' has no effect, as the Arduino Due has no voltage regulator to supply power to other devices.

=item * Option 'buspirate_pullup' only affects JTAG signals TDI, TDO, TCK and TMS, like in the Bus Pirate.

The reset signals TRST and SRST are not affected (have no pull-up option).

Note that the built-in pull-ups on the Atmel ATSAM3X8 are too weak (between 50 and 150 KOhm)
to be of any use. On my dodgy test set-up, and once looked at TCK with the oscilloscope,
and the rising edges were very long curves, the speed was not enough to run reliably
at as low as 24 KHz.

=item * If you set option 'buspirate_mode' to 'open-drain', JtagDue will use the Atmel ATSAM3X8's "Multi Drive Control" (Open Drain) mode.

Therefore, you need to enable the internal pull-ups (which are probably too weak, see above)
or have external ones in order to guarantee a high level on the lines when necessary.

=item * Command 'buspirate_led' has no effect.

The only LED on the Arduino Due is used as a heartbeat indicator at the moment.
